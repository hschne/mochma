## FAQ

### Why would you do this in bash?

I like bash. 


### What's with the project name? 

I'm glad you asked. "Moch ma" is austrian slang that loosely translates to "let's do it, but actually don't. You and me both know we'll just forget about this". I thought that was fitting for code TODOs :man_shrugging:
